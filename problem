Write a Python script that does the followings.

1. Generate a list of random numbers of length 100.
2. Define three functions that calculates mean, variance and standard deviation.
    The function name should be lilke - mymean_<yourname>, myvariance_<yourname>, mystddev_<yourname>
3. Execute these functions by passing the randomly generate lists and print the result.
    The result should be printed in the following format.
     Name: <yourname>
     Mean: <mean-value>
     Variance: <variance-value>
     Standard Deviation: <stddev-value>
4. Create a visualization that shows the data points in your dataset and also show a horizontal line representing the mean value.

Do these things in a Colab Notebook and submit the link of the notebook in the private comment box.
